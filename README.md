# Introduction to Python for Data Science

This is a set of notes used for teaching Python to students that have never used Python, or programmed in any language. In a usual semester, it takes approximately 4 weeks (meeting twice a week for an hour) to go through the material, for a freshmen undergraduate class. 

## Notes

* The notes are in the form of iPython notebooks and are stored under the `/notes` folder.
* You can [open the notes in Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ipeirotis/introduction-to-python/blob/master/). With Google Colab, you can save your work in your Google Drive. 
* If you do not want to use Google Colab, you can [launch the notes in Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ipeirotis/introduction-to-python/master), which is a temporary Jupyter server launched on-demand. Note that the Binder server will shutdown after a period of idleness. If you want to save your work, and you should save the notes locally to your computer.

## Recommended Books

* [Python for Everybody: Exploring Data In Python 3](https://www.py4e.com/book): This is a textbook for students that are learning Python as their first programming language, with the objective of using programming to handle and analyze data. 
* [Automate the Boring Stuff using Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com): A task-driven textbook that teaches Python by focusing on how to automate various tasks, using programming.


## Additional Books for Learning Python

* [How To Think Like a Computer Scientist](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/thinkcspy/index.html): An interactive guide to programming and Python. The book "Python for Everybody" (listed above) is partially based on this book.
* [Learn Python the Hard Way](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/python3/): An introduction to programming and Python. It targets complete beginners. It used a drill-based approach for teaching, which can be tedious at times. Nevertheless, it is considered one of the standard textbooks for learning Python.

## Credits

* I ~~have stolen~~ relied heavily on the "Python for Everybody" and the "How To Think Like a Computer Scientist" books to develop the structure and the material for the notes. 
* The initial version of the notebooks came from Josh Attenberg, from his course "Practical Data Science" that was taught at NYU/Stern.
* Katherine Hoffmann contributed to the development of the current notebooks.
